# Imperfect Gamers Website Scope
###### Status- ~~Production Ready Website Sprint~~, ~~Sprint evaluation~~, Mockup Creation

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is, to begin with, a modern and responsive website that will ultimately allow us, the owners, to expand the capabilities of the website. As a gaming server, Imperfect Gamers has historically been challenged with limited resources for managing its various organizational requests. As a result, Imperfect Gamers has lost the vision to always strive and improve the players' experience. In response, some of our initiatives have experienced delays, exceeded their budgets, or have not properly met their deliverables. By starting the IGWS Project, Imperfect Gamers can better leverage its data by establishing a way for players and staff to communicate and access user information all in one place. The successful implementation of this project is anticipated to increase user satisfaction and trust in the journey to becoming more than just an online gaming-server but an entertainment platform.

## Description
The scope of the IGWS Project is to build and implement a system that aggregates all of Imperfect Gamers data. This includes allowing the user to enter data and metrics in a consistent matter. A mockup will be provided to help push the project to the finish. 

## Requirements
The IGWS Project is a business need for Imperfect Gamers. To meet this business need, several requirements must be met for successful execution.

**The following requirements have been identified:**
- Full-responsive layout with full mobile-support
- Multi-purpose search tool for various database tables
- Theme to ensure all pages are consistent
- A blank multi-purpose page for future implementation
- Ability to maintain website internally without contract support (limitations: HTML, CSS, PHP, and JS)

## Boundaries
The IGWS Project includes all work associated with building and implementing the site for Imperfect Gamers. This includes gathering input from the owner, code work, server configuration, tests, troubleshoots, and the official deployment of the site across the organization. This is not limited to training information and materials associated with maintaining the website internally. 

**Not included in the scope of this project are: **
- Ongoing maintenance of the system
- Ongoing help desk and/or service support
- Hardware/software upgrades

## Strategy
For the IGWS Project strategy, Imperfect Gamers will leverage the expertise of a team of two, one marketer, and one developer from the Absolve Group. These two experts will be in matrixed support as part of a team conjoined with the owner. They will aid the owner in coding work, server configuration, testing, troubleshooting, and the official deployment of the site across the organization. These two experts will also assist the owner by validating conceptual and technical designs that will serve as the mockup for the IGWS Project. The owner will ensure that the two experts incorporate all input from the community and gathered requirements.

## Deliverables
1.  A tested and operational website free of errors and meeting the specifications described in the IGWS Project Description.
2. A tested and operational website skeleton (as part of future implementation in the IGWS Project Requirements). 
3. A complete and thorough user manual that provides step by step instructions on how players and staff can access and submit data.
4. A complete and thorough troubleshooting guide that provides corrective steps for the owner to maintain the website internally for all anticipated problems.

## Acceptance Criteria
To ensure thorough vetting and successful completion, the IGWS Project has adopted Acceptance Criteria.

**To achieve success the following qualitative criteria must be met:**
1. Meet all deliverables within the scheduled time and budget tolerances.
2. Improve Imperfect Gamers' search-engine-optimization and follow CDN practices.
3. Accomplish an overall web accessibility evaluation for responsiveness and mobile support.
4. Practice SOLID principles in making a loosely coupled master-page that will serve as the base for the website with an ability to retrofit components such as search, bans, and applications responsively.  

## Constraints
Several constraints have been identified for the IGWS Project. Considerations must be made for these constraints throughout the project lifecycle. All owners of Imperfect Gamers must remain mindful of these constraints as they must be carefully thought for to prevent any adverse consequences to the project's schedule, cost, or scope. 
The following constraints have been identified:
The project must be completed the 29th of May, 2020.
Website must conform to existing web-applications (SourceBans, PromtheusIPN, and MyBB) as no new software will be adopted for usage.
Project must be completed within budget tolerance.

## Assumptions
Several assumptions have been identified for the IGWS Project. Considerations must be made for these assumptions as they introduce some level of risk to the project until they're confirmed to be true.

**During the projects development process every effort must be made to identify and mitigate any risk associated with the following assumptions:**
- Absolve group is capable of handling all of the deliverables with the cooperation of the owner and his input.
- The IGWS Project has full support from other owners and staff members within Imperfect Gamers.
