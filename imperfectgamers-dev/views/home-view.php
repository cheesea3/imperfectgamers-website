                    <br><br>
                    <p>
                        Thank you guys so so much for your support and patience. You guys rock.
                        It means the world to us :)
                        <br><br>
                        To start, we must first give thanks to our entire staff team at Imperfect Gamers (IG). They have had all hands on deck, taking higher responsibilities than normal to ensure that you guys get to have fun during these trying times without any worry about the interruptions that we've been having.
                        <br><br>
                    <h2>Why you're here...</h2>
                    We have finished the development of a new timer for IG, keeping the good features and leaving the bad. This was the result of a long list of community concerns about the constant lag that was making IG sometimes unplayable until restart. Despite all of the issues we've been having...you guys showed out and still chose to stay and play! Thanks so much for your loyalty and long-time support. <b>You're why we do this</b>.
                    <br>
                    While the timer is finished, we still have to be cautious in rolling it out to IG until we are fully aware of what we are pushing out to everyone. We want to make sure it's something for everyone, your concerns are valid and we need to know. If you think you have been on the server long enough to be able to identify what features are either missing or not fully working- then we need your help more than ever to come and test by the staff teams side.
                    <br><br>
                    <h2>Opportunities</h2>
                    You're records are not lost. They have been moved to a dummy account and will be available to track on our website alongside the game.
                    <br>
                    If you are a skill surfer on IG then testing the new timer means you will have a head-start on points! This chance will allow you to snag and score some records before everyone else! You will also be able to flex your new records in the #records channel live in Discord.
                    <br>
                    If you're either a rapper, dj, producer, or spectator then now is the perfect time to go ahead and request WHAT YOU WANT to see in the server.
                    <br><br>
                    <h2>To connect</h2>
                    Information on the server and how to connect
                    <br>
                    <code><b>#serverIP</b> 74.91.112.156:27015
                        <b>#password</b> timer</code>
                    <br>
                    To connect, add the <code><b>#serverIP</b> (74.91.112.156:27015)</code> to your favorites tab through the community server browser that is accessible from the main lobby of the game. Then, hit refresh so it shows up in the list and then select the server and click connect. You will be then prompted for a password and that is where you use the <b>#password</b> (timer).
                    <br><br>
                    <h2>Reporting</h2>
                    If there is an issue on the test server that you wish to report
                    <br>
                    Go ahead and type !bug in chat or type sm_bug in your console and follow through the prompt.
